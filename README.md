# ASL-to-Text Translator  

This project is an AI-powered system designed to translate American Sign Language (ASL) into text using real-time webcam input or pre-recorded video. By analyzing hand movements and gestures, the software aims to improve accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.  

## Project Goals  
The primary objective of this project is to help bridge the communication gap between ASL users and people that do not know sign language by providing a real-time translation tool. Unlike traditional ASL translation methods that rely on human interpreters, this program offers a free independent, accessible, and scalable solution.  

## How It Works  
The software captures video input, detects and tracks hand movements, and translates recognized ASL signs into text.

## Impact  
This project is developed as part of a scholarship submission for the Hoover Foundation, highlighting the role of technology in improving communication accessibility. 

## Future Development  
Planned improvements include expanding the ASL vocabulary coverage, enhancing gesture recognition accuracy, and optimizing real-time performance. The long-term vision is to integrate this technology into mobile and web applications to reach a broader audience.
